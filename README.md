# ClanRaids
A Minecraft plugin that has a unique way to raid other clans

Each clan has two regions they can claim.
Clans can upgrade their tiers to get larger region size.
Upgrading to each tier will cost certain amount of money depending on the plugin config.

**Each clan has two regions:**

Region 1: The largest region and should cover the whole base

Region 2: Has to be inside region 1 and is usually where valubles are kept and is more protected. Way smaller compared to region 1

**Region disruptors are blocks that when placed next to a protected region, will start a countdown that will temporarily disable region protections**

**Becareful! Region disruptors can be destroyed so raiders will need to defend it carefully**

**Region disruptors will only disable one region so if raiders will want to get in to both regions, they will need to bring two**

**To make a region disruptor you will need to collect core fragments by killing the players in the clan**

**Once you have enough core fragments you do the command /clan forge (clan name)**
